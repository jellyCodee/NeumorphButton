# Nuemorph Button

A simple, modern, beautiful looking button to style up your......I don't even know why I did this.

Probably out of boredom but anyway here I am writing a ReadMe for it and here you are reading it, hopefully.

Always read the ReadMe before you steal the code (just kidding, I know you're not a thief, you're just borrowing), it's very necessary.

To access the code just click on that green box that says 'Code' and select the 'Download ZIP' to download the files.

But for my terminal and git geeks (yeah that's right I see you) you know what to do. Just copy the link instead and use '_git clone_' dawg üòé

Just like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/jellyCodee/e-commerce-app.git
```


Now let's see what the button looks like shall we

Button Off

Button On

And with that we come to the end of the Readme. How noble of you to have made it to the end.
